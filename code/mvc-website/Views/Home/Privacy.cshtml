            <h2>Tracking User Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                Cascadian may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within Cascadian, in order to determine what Cascadian services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Cascadian to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
            </p>
            <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
            <p>
                Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by Cascadian. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Cascadian website.
            </p>
            <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                The Cascadian website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Cascadian pages, or register with Cascadian site or services, a cookie helps Cascadian to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Cascadian website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Cascadian features that you customized.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Cascadian services or websites you visit.

                <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                Cascadian secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Cascadian uses the following methods for this purpose: <br />
